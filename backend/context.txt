A GPSDO is a fancy leash for an oscillator that likes to wander.

Inside: a decent local oscillator (usually OCXO or TCXO) that outputs a clean, stable frequency.
GPS provides a 1 PPS signal. It’s ugly but accurate over the long term.
A control loop (PLL or software disciplining loop) compares the oscillator’s phase/frequency to GPS 1 PPS.
The loop slowly nudges the oscillator to cancel drift. Slow on purpose, so GPS noise doesn’t ruin short-term stability.
Result: short-term stability from the oscillator, long-term accuracy from GPS.

If GPS drops out, the oscillator free-runs using its last correction (holdover).
